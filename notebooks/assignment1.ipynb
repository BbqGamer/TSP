    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Greedy methods are nice in the sense that they are easy to implement and to run, in particular NNHead method was very fast (it works in linear time), even if the results weren't too good they were significantly better than random solution, however the solutions from NNHead result in a lot of big jumps which is quite unoptimal. NNWhole results in slightly better results, but probably not enough to justify its higher complexity $O(n^2)$. The best Greedy algorithm out of three tested was GreedyCycle, it resulted in solutions that were more compressed, you can see a step improvement in the results however for the price of the complexity, this algorithm works in $O(n^3)$"
